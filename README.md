# 30-Days-of-learning-Twitter-Analysis.
Analysing the tweets of the 30 days of learning program.

## Data Source
Data used for this analysis was gotten from https://github.com/theoyinbooke/30Days-of-Learning-Data-Analysis-Using-Power-BI-for-Students/tree/main/Twitter%20Data%20Web%20Scrape .

## Data
Data was imported into PowerBI. Familiarised myself with the columns of data that had been brought in to get an idea of what kind of insights could be generated from them.
Afterwards took time to design visually appealing,interactive dashboard showing some insights about the 30 days of learning program such as the Users who had tweeted the most. Unsurprisingly the program organise Olanrewaju Oyinboke was top there.Insight was also generated as to the ocations in which users were tweeting the most from.
