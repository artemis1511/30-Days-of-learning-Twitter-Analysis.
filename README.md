# 30-Days-of-learning-Twitter-Analysis.
Analysing the tweets of the 30 days of learning program.

## Data Source
Data used for this analysis was gotten from https://github.com/theoyinbooke/30Days-of-Learning-Data-Analysis-Using-Power-BI-for-Students/tree/main/Twitter%20Data%20Web%20Scrape .

## Data Analysis 
Data was imported into PowerBI. Familiarised myself with the columns of data that had been brought in to get an idea of what kind of insights could be generated from them.

## Data visualization

Above is an image of a dashboard made from the report containing the most important details of the analysis.

Took time to design visually appealing,interactive multi page report which gives an overview of the project with key figures such as people involved with the program as in the total number of users who used the hashtag #30 days of learning &ng30daysoflearning , total number of tweets . Also shows days with most tweets.
Report is also able to show some other insights about the 30 days of learning program such as the users who had tweeted the most. Unsurprisingly the program organiser Olanrewaju Oyinboke was top there.Insight was also generated as to the locations from which users were tweeting the most from.
This Report is able to give us a detailed look into the 30 days of learning program by giving us an overview of the project via the key metrics and also going into detail where necessary .

The report is also included if you wish to interact with it.
